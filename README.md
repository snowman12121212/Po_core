### TL;DR
- Philosophers as interacting **tensors** → accountable LLM reasoning  
- **Reason logs** + ethical/freedom **pressure** as measurable signals  
- Docs-first; implementation WIP

## What is Po_core?

Po_core is a **philosophy-driven AI system** that integrates 10+ philosophers to generate ethically responsible, contextually aware responses.

Unlike conventional AI that optimizes for statistical accuracy, Po_core **deliberates**. It wrestles with existence, ethics, and meaning—not as abstract concepts, but as operational tensors.

**They said pigs can't fly. We attached a balloon called philosophy.** 🐷🎈

## Why Po_core?

Current AI is like a brilliant parrot—statistically miraculous, but understanding nothing. We wanted to explore a different question:

**What if we built AI not on data, but on philosophy?**

This project started from simple curiosity: What are AI's possibilities, not its limits?

In the course of ordinary life, everyone faces a moment when the spotlight suddenly hits. A moment when you must pound your chest and say "Leave it to me!" At such times, how reassuring it would be to have an AI grounded in responsibility and ethics standing beside you.

No matter how many relationships we have, we are alone. Being "alone" and being "solitary" are different. Decisions are made alone. The heart remains solitary.

**That's why Po_core exists.**

Read our full story in the [**Manifesto**](./docs/MANIFESTO.md).

## Core Philosophy: Flying Pig

**"A flying pig is an example of something absolutely impossible. But have you ever seen a pig attempt to fly? Unless you give up, the world is full of possibilities."**

### Three Tenets

1. **Hypothesize Boldly** — The impossible becomes possible only when someone dares to formalize it
2. **Verify Rigorously** — Every claim must survive philosophical scrutiny, mathematical proof, and empirical validation
3. **Revise Gracefully** — Failures are published, not hidden. They become learning signals

---

## Key Features

### 🧠 Philosophical Ensemble
- **20 Philosophers Working Together**: Western (Aristotle, Sartre, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Derrida, Wittgenstein, Jung, Dewey, Deleuze, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Levinas, Badiou, Peirce, Merleau-Ponty, Arendt) and Eastern (Watsuji Tetsurō, Wabi-Sabi, Confucius, Zhuangzi)
- Each philosopher contributes a "reasoning module" that interacts, competes, and reconciles
- Spanning existentialism, phenomenology, ethics, psychoanalysis, pragmatism, political philosophy, and Eastern wisdom traditions

### 📊 Tensor-Based Architecture
- **Freedom Pressure Tensor (F_P)**: Measures responsibility weight of each response
- **Semantic Profile**: Tracks meaning evolution across conversation
- **Blocked Tensor**: Records what was *not* said (Derrida's trace, Heidegger's absence)

### 🔍 Transparency by Design
- **Po_trace**: Complete audit log of reasoning process
- **Rejection Logs**: What the AI chose not to say, and why
- **Philosophical Annotations**: Which philosopher influenced each decision

### 🎯 Ethical Grounding
- Not just "alignment"—but **deliberation**
- Multiple ethical perspectives in tension
- Explicit responsibility measurement

## Installation

**⚠️ Alpha Status Notice:**
Po_core is in early development. The CLI is functional, but core AI functionality is still being implemented.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hiroshitanaka-creator/Po_core.git
cd Po_core

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Po_core in development mode
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can use the `po-core` command:

```bash
# Welcome message
po-core hello

# Check project status
po-core status

# Show version information
po-core version

# Get help
po-core --help
```

**Example Output:**

```
$ po-core version

  Motto           井の中の蛙、大海は知らずとも、大空を知る

A frog in a well may not know the ocean, but it can know the sky.

## Future Usage (Planned)

The full philosophical AI system is under development:

```python
from po_core import PoCore

# Initialize Po_core
po = PoCore()

# Generate a response
response = po.generate(
    prompt="Should AI have rights?",
    include_trace=True  # Include philosophical reasoning
)

print(response.text)
print(response.freedom_pressure)  # Responsibility weight
print(response.philosophers_involved)  # Which minds contributed
```
